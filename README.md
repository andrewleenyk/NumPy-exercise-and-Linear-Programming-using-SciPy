# NumPy exercise and Linear Programming using SciPy

This is my Homework 3 from DS 210 at Boston University. The first part of the homework is an exercise in NumPy array manipulation, the second part
is of Linear Programming. Linear Programming which is a supervised machine learning model that will calculate
a value that represents an optimal outcome. Using the SciPy linear programming model, I was able to find the best number of different bakery pastries 
to make given constraints on ingredients and the goal to optimize revenue.
